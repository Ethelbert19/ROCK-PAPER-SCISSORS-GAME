Project Description
This is a simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Python. The game pits the user against a computer opponent, with the computer's choice generated randomly. Players can continue playing rounds until they choose to quit, at which point the game displays the final scores and declares an overall winner based on the number of rounds won.
